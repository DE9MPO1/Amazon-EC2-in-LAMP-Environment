# Launch an Amazon EC2 in LAMP Environment
## ECV Bootcamp

The following procedures help you install an Apache web server with PHP and MySQL support on your Amazon Linux instance (sometimes called a LAMP web server or LAMP stack). You can use this server to host a static website or deploy a dynamic PHP application that reads and writes information to a database.

This lab introduces you to [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/ec2/) using the AWS Management Console.
